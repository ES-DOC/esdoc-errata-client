                    The publication workflow on the ESGF nodes requires to deal with errata issues.
                    The cause behind the version changes has to be published alongside the data: what was updated,
                    retracted or removed, and why. Consequently, the publication of a new version of a dataset has to
                    be motivated by an issue.|n|n

                    "esgissue" allows the referenced data providers to easily create, document, update, close or remove
                    a validated issue.
