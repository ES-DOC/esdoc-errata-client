    usage: esgissue [-h] [-V]  ...

    The publication workflow on the ESGF nodes requires to deal with errata issues. The background of
    the version changes has to be published alongside the data: what was updated, retracted or removed,
    and why. Consequently, the publication of a new version of a dataset has to be motivated by an
    issue.

    "issue-manager" allows the referenced data providers to easily create, document, update, close or
    remove a validated issue. The issue registration always appears prior to the publication process and
    should be mandatory for additional version, version removal or retraction.

    "issue-manager" works with both JSON and TXT files. This allows the data provider in charge of ESGF
    issues to manage one or several JSON templates gathering the issues locally.

    See full documentation on http://esgissue.readthedocs.org/

    Optional arguments:
      -h, --help  Show this help message and exit.

      -V          Program version.

Create an issue
---------------

Creating an issue is a vital part of the errata service, as the all idea revolves around the community contributions.
However, creating an issue must abide to a set of rules enforced by the json validation.

Mandatory issue json file fields:

  - title,
  - description,
  - severity,
  - models

dataset list txt file should not be empty, otherwise the command will fail.

.. note the log argument is optional, if not used, the standard output will be used.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> issue-manager create --issue /path/to/issue.json --dsets /path/to/datasets.txt --log /path/to/logfile

If a the the issue json file is not properly formed as described in the json templates:

.. code-block:: bash


   $> issue-manager create --issue /path/to/issue_missing_title.json --dsets /path/to/datasets.txt --log /path/to/logfile

    - Missing title (applies to all mandatory parameters):

.. note On success the local issue file will be modified, so please make sure the client has sufficient writing rights
to the file. The creation and update dates will be appended as well as the issue uid and status.

Update an issue
---------------

Once an issue is created, it might be subject to some changes, whether it regards the content of the issue (description
for instance) or the status of the issue (changing status). The update of an issue is a key part of the issue life-cycle.

It has a similar structure as the creation command, and also similar constraints, plus a few more that will be detailed here.

Some attributes cannot be changed. If a mistake occurred while declaring the issue, it should be reported to the admins.
These attributes consist in:

- Title
- Project
- Institute.

As well as the key dates in the issue file (creation, update, closed dates), those should not be modified in order to
preserve an authentic set of records, in case of compromised local records users can use the retrieve command to download
fresh copies from the errata server.

Another major additional constraint is the modification of the issue description. As a matter of fact updating the
description is controlled by a variation threshold that should not be exceeded. Which is currently set at 20%, if the
description is to be changed more than that, the issue should be closed and the creation of a brand new issue is required.


.. code-block:: bash

   $> issue-manager update --issue /path/to/issue.json --dsets /path/to/new_datasets.txt --log /path/to/logfile


    2016/09/06 05:45:14 PM INFO Validating of issue...
    2016/09/06 05:45:15 PM INFO Validation Result: SUCCESSFUL
    2016/09/06 05:45:15 PM INFO Update issue #66b1b471-221a-42ac-ad69-0a048e924cd4
    2016/09/06 05:45:15 PM INFO Issue has been updated successfully!



If a the issue.json or dsets.txt file is missing from options:

.. code-block:: bash

   $> issue-manager update --dsets esgissue/samples/dsets1.txt

    issue-manager update --dsets esgissue/samples/dsets1.txt usage: esgissue update [--log [$PWD]] [-v] [-h] --issue [PATH/issue.json] --dsets [PATH/dsets.list]
    esgissue update: error: argument --issue is required

.. note The previously explained safeguards for the issue creation are also valid in the update context, empty dataset
lists are rejected as well as malformed dataset ids. The issue json should always be conform to the templates otherwise
an exception will be thrown.


Close an issue
--------------

At the end of an issue's lifecycle, it should be marked as a closed issue.
To do so a specific close command is made available in the errata client.
.. note To close an issue it should not have a status Wont_fix or New.

The close command has a similar structure to the creation and update.

.. code-block:: bash

   $> issue-manager close --issue /path/to/issue.json --dsets /path/to/new_datasets.txt --log /path/to/logfile

    2016/09/06 06:27:53 PM INFO Validating of issue...
    2016/09/06 06:27:53 PM INFO Validation Result: SUCCESSFUL
    2016/09/06 06:27:53 PM INFO Closing issue #66b1b471-221a-42ac-ad69-0a048e924cd4
    2016/09/06 06:27:53 PM INFO Issue has been closed successfully!

.. note The close command also modifies the issue files by adding the close date and changing the status.


Retrieving issues:
------------------

At some point it might be a good idea to keep a local copy of the errata information hosted within the errata system.
The retrieve command has been designed in the aim of either downloading a specific issue files, a set of specific issues,
or the whole lot of issues hosted within the errata system (for archiving purposes for example).

The command takes as arguments the list of uids (optional, leave blank if all issues are expected), the json file directory
and the dataset list txt file directory the user wishes to use.

.. Note in case of multiple issues download it is mandatory the path provided for issues and directories be a directory.
In the case of a single issue download, a json and txt file would be sufficient.

.. code-block:: bash


    $> issue-manager retrieve --issue esgissue/samples/downloads --dsets esgissue/samples/downloads
    --id 66b1b471-221a-42ac-ad69-0a048e924cd4

    2016/09/06 06:44:28 PM INFO processing id 66b1b471-221a-42ac-ad69-0a048e924cd4
    2016/09/06 06:44:28 PM INFO Issue has been downloaded.

This command the issue with id #66b1b471-221a-42ac-ad69-0a048e924cd4 has been downloaded to the downloads directory.
The naming convention used in creating the issue related files is issue_<uid>.json & dset_<uid>.txt

.. note if needed we could have specified json and txt file in this example since we are downloading a single issue.

Multiple downloads:

.. code-block:: bash

    $> issue-manager retrieve --issue esgissue/samples/downloads --dsets esgissue/samples/downloads
    --id 66b1b471-221a-42ac-ad69-0a048e924cd4 8f8178db-d772-449d-86d2-90385479f8e6

    2016/09/06 06:49:39 PM INFO processing id 66b1b471-221a-42ac-ad69-0a048e924cd4
    2016/09/06 06:49:39 PM INFO Issue has been downloaded.
    2016/09/06 06:49:39 PM INFO processing id 8f8178db-d772-449d-86d2-90385479f8e6
    2016/09/06 06:49:39 PM INFO Issue has been downloaded.

Multiple downloads with file instead of directory as argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    $>issue-manager retrieve --issue esgissue/samples/issue.json --dsets esgissue/samples/dset.txt
    --id 66b1b471-221a-42ac-ad69-0a048e924cd4 8f8178db-d772-449d-86d2-90385479f8e6

    You have provided multiple ids but a single file as destination, aborting.
