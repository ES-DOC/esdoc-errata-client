Create an issue
===============

Issue moderation is a key step in ingesting crowd sourced errata entries.
In order to be able to moderate issues, you have to be part of the errata moderation team.

Once you have been accepted into the relevant moderation team you should be able to connect and access the moderation
board.

Every new proposal has a 14 day grace period, after which, regardless of moderation action, it will be
visible on the front page of the errata service.

The actions possible for a moderator are:


- Accept
- Reject
- Update

This has been designed to enabe moderators either to simply accept the proposal as is, or to modify it
by adding/retracting information (could be description items or dataset ids), or to reject the content
when deeemed simply not a relevant errata entry.
The errata service does not enable conversation on the service itself. However the notification email
contains the contributors' email address, that can be used subsequently to further discuss the errata
contribution nature, motivation etc.
