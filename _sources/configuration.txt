Configuration
=============

The esgf-errata-client doesn't require much configuration.
The activate file once sourced will set the environment variables and proper aliases.
The esgf-client.ini file contains some constants required, that might be subject to change in the future.
However constantly updating the file from the project's repository might be the best practice here.
